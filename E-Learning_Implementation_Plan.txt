# Community-Centered E-Learning Platform - Implementation Plan

## 🚀 Step 1: Setup & Planning (Week 1)
✅ **Define Development Environment**
- Choose a **backend**: Django (Python) for API development.
- Choose a **frontend**: React.js for a lightweight UI.
- Set up the **database**: PostgreSQL (for online use) and SQLite (for offline storage).

✅ **Create Initial Code Repositories**
- Set up a **GitHub repository** for version control.
- Organize project folders (`backend`, `frontend`, `docs`, etc.).

✅ **Build Basic API Structure**
- Initialize a **Django project** with `django-rest-framework` (DRF).
- Create `User`, `Course`, `Lesson`, and `ProgressTracker` models.

---

## 🛠 Step 2: Develop Core Features (Weeks 2–6)
✅ **User Authentication (Week 2)**
- Implement **JWT-based authentication**.
- Create **sign-up, login, and user roles (Student, Teacher, Admin)**.

✅ **Offline Learning Support (Weeks 3–4)**
- Develop **content download functionality** for offline access.
- Implement **automatic progress syncing** when back online.

✅ **Course & Lesson Management (Week 5)**
- Enable **teachers to add/edit courses, lessons, and quizzes**.
- Ensure **students can enroll in courses and view content**.

✅ **Progress Tracking & Reports (Week 6)**
- Implement **student progress tracking** in `ProgressTracker`.
- Build a **dashboard for teachers to view student reports**.

---

## 📊 Step 3: Testing & Refinements (Weeks 7–8)
✅ **Run Unit & Integration Tests**
- Use **pytest** and **Postman** for API testing.
- Conduct **manual and automated UI testing**.

✅ **Optimize Performance & Security**
- Implement **AES-256 encryption for user data**.
- Optimize **API response times** (target <3s).

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Deployment & Training (Weeks 9–11)
✅ **Deploy Backend on Cloud (AWS/Azure)**
✅ **Deploy Frontend (Netlify/Vercel)**
✅ **Train teachers and students on platform usage**

## Next Steps:
**1️⃣ Choose where to begin: Backend, Frontend, or Database?**
**2️⃣ Would you like me to generate the initial code structure for you?**
