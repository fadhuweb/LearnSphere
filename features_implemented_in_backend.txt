🚀 Next Steps
Now that we’ve recapped all backend permissions, we need to connect these features to the frontend.

What would you like to do first?
1️⃣ Connect authentication (Login/Register API with Axios)?
2️⃣ Set up the dashboard (Show different UI for Admin, Teacher, Student)?
3️⃣ Connect courses (Display assigned/enrolled courses)?
4️⃣ Connect quizzes & grading?

Let me know, and we’ll start implementing! 🚀
